In America, Americans — and the rest of the people in America – covet the freedom of speech. These Americans value freedom of speech above all. However, it does not seem like they understand the price of freedom of speech. After all, free speech is not free, even from a legislative perspective. It comes with intricate complexity.

Now I may be wrong, given that Americans commonly talk about the First Amendment.

Let me repeat that if you missed my brilliance.

Americans commonly _talk_ about the First Amendment. Now, of course, due to the prominent rational discussion, of which ideas are exchanged and built upon as the result of the First Amendment, the common American understands the concept freedom of speech.

Following this reasoning, most of the public should probably understand the consequences of the First Amendment. They understand that there are federal restrictions, some state restrictions, some other exceptions, some exceptions to the exceptions, and a vast barrage of legislation dictating the exact nuance of speech. This nuance prevents smart-asses, accompanied by their dumb-ass friends, from saying, &quot;Well, I don&#39;t think you waking up four in the morning on the weekend and pulling the fire-alarm four-in-the-fucking-morning rises to the claim of free speech.&quot; The First Amendment would not view pulling the fire alarm, in four-in-the-fucking-morning, as free of speech. Die in a fire, David. It&#39;ll be like the boy who cried wolf but modernized.

The outdated version, however, would be for David to die in a crowded theater while yelling fire. This version is outdated because nobody goes to theaters, willingly, nor would people believe him. This quote, yelling fire in a crowded theater, comes from Holmes, a United States Supreme Court Justice and part-time detective. Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52 (1919). Although Schenck was about anti-war sentiments peacefully expressed through a pamphlet, has been effectively reversed in later decisions, and the fire quote was about an extreme hypothetical situation, it&#39;s still relevant for today&#39;s society. Apparently, individuals have not had any free time since 1919 to read the quote or the sign&#39;s phrasing which had been considered too extreme. The sign, which convicted Schenck, said, &quot;Do not submit to intimidation.&quot; Id. at 51. As a result, when looking at the context, the quote about yelling fire in a crowded theater is an old flawed metaphor.

The Atlantic times, for example, points out some instances of its misuse. It considers the instance of [New York City councilmen Peter Vallone](http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/councilman-pushes-for-charges-against-twitter-user), who declared, &quot;Everyone knows the example of yelling fire in a crowded movie theater&quot; (Timm). Vallone uses the fire in a crowded theater, almost as a rule when attempting to press charges against a pseudonymous Twitter user for posting misinformation. Other cases include a pastor threatening to burn Qurans or the charges against WikiLeaks (Timm). Both instances again treat the quote as a rule, despite its questionable 99-year-old relevancy.

Let me put this quote in perspective. If this quote were to hold the legal bearing, then it would be illegal to oppose any ongoing war through a pamphlet that says, &#39;No War. Frowny Face!&#39; The Supreme Court overturned the Schenck decision, which previously ruled a restriction on &quot;clear and present danger,&quot; and transformed it to &quot;imminent lawless action.&quot; Brandenburg v. Ohio, 95 U.S. 444, 447. This difference, albeit a simple change in wording, is the main distinction.

In direct contradiction to this complexity, the First Amendment is simple. The issue concerning the freedom of speech even more simple, it&#39;s is less than a sentence. The First Amendment in full states:

&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances&quot; (My American T-Shirt).

The question then is, where this nuance lies. It lies within the legislative and judicial systems, justifying the extent to which the constitution is interpreted. Furthermore, the specific language only precludes an action taken on behalf of Congress, in other words, the government. Thus, other individuals, including business entities, are not burdened with protecting your free speech.

So, let&#39;s look towards my original bastardization of David, the asshole that pulled the fire alarm at 4 in the morning. For the intent of this argument, allow me to assume that pulling the fire alarm, and yelling fire would be equal. If you disagree with this juxtaposition, consider this brief argument. The fire alarm is merely a communication device that instantly transmits a message to anyone in its radius. It does so through screeching the fire alarm sound that we all know and hate. It also transmits a signal to the nearest fire station, calling for help. In other words, the separation is only by the difference of an individual&#39;s voice, to an individual using a device to transmit their voice.

We understand that Congress cannot abridge the freedom of speech, given the First Amendment. We also understand that at least two Supreme Court cases modified some exceptions to the freedom of speech. The latest exception defines a restriction on &quot;imminent lawless action.&quot; Id.

Given this argument, would pulling the fire alarm, at four-in-the-fucking-morning, be protected or denied?

First, let me provide additional context. This perspective would not be from a business point of view because that argument would be needlessly complicated compared to the argument on &#39;lawless&#39; action. The needless complication arises over several issues. People who falsely pull fire alarms, four-in-the-fucking-morning, are not a protected class. A business could fire a person if they falsely pull a fire alarm. Bentley University is a private institution but is also federally subsidized. Since this issue gets distorted, let&#39;s assume that Bentley University is a governmental entity restricting your speech in regards to pulling a fire alarm with misleading intent.

From the perspective of law, pulling a fire alarm appears not to be protected. In Massachusetts, pulling a fire alarm without reasonable cause can be punished up to five hundred dollars or impressment in jail up to a year. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, § 4-13. As a result, it seems as if the government does not recognize falsely pulling a fire alarm in the light of freedom of speech. To that extent, pulling the fire alarm does not incite imminent lawless action, although I did want to kill David.

What gives?

The exception listed in Brandenburg is only one source of law to determine the First Amendment&#39;s freedom of speech clause. Although I&#39;ve hinted at it, the government can regulate most speech, if it passes a scrutiny test. This test means that if the government can justify it, then it can limit speech in some ways. For example, falsely pulling a fire alarm is against the law. The way that this law is justified is by looking at it from an intermediate scrutiny test (Kirschner). This test weighs the government&#39;s substantial interest against an individual&#39;s right to freedom of speech.

When applying this test to our &#39;hypothetical,&#39; David falsely pulling the fire alarm four-in-the-fucking-morning, the government&#39;s substantial interests are quite clear. Fire trucks come to Bentley University immediately, treating like each case with the same seriousness. First, this dilutes the effectiveness of the fire station. If one truck is at Bentley, then there is one less fire truck available for other disasters. Secondly, the government funds the fire stations. In an interview by Ian Bennet, the Deputy Chief of a fire-crew, he estimates the costs between $300 and $600. Assuming the lower-end of Bennet&#39;s estimation, David&#39;s fire alarm venture cost the government around $300 and potentially endangered other victims with the fire alarm. Also, he woke me up four-in-the-fucking-morning. Well, it seems reasonable for the government to prevent both the cost and danger to citizens, especially considering that the hypothetical would not limit _content._

That means that the government is not restricting the message. Non-content-based restrictions fall into this intermediate scrutiny test. As a result, the intermediate scrutiny test would likely justify the fire alarm rule with &quot;reasonable cause.&quot; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 269, § 4-13.

And once again, like the constitution, reasonable cause is interpreted through a preponderance of resources, including precedent law from the Supreme Court to Federal Courts to State Supreme Courts. Now it is overwhelmingly likely that pulling the fire alarm without reasonable cause, like was done in David&#39;s case, is not going to be upheld.

Of course, what if David had smelled something burning? What if the damnable tradition of pulling the fire alarm on Spring day, four-in-the-fucking-morning was purely coincidental? Law is complicated to the extent that even when given the rule, the rule gets explained through later precedents.

Before we delve more into the legality, the big takeaway should be to understand this complexity. Examine another case, where the Supreme Court upheld the First Amendment over the privacy interests of a funeral. The West Borough Baptist Church had picketed a military veteran&#39;s burial and campaigned against the ongoing war efforts. Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. 443. For the court, the question presented was whether the First Amendment protected protesters at a funeral from inflicting emotional distress on the family of the deceased.

Once again, let&#39;s look at the big picture. The case did not stand on purely the merits of the First Amendment. Instead, it&#39;s whether the amendment successfully protects the liability from inflicting emotional distress.

The court looked towards the context and found that the Amendment would protect the church from the liability. They found that the arguments that claimed that church&#39;s interreference in with the funeral was disruptive were ineffective. The church was abiding by the thousand feet mark and left before the funeral proceeded. Therefore, the argument of interference does not stand.

The court also considered the argument where it attempted to verify the emotional harm. However, because political speech is more protected than other forms, the emotional harm caused by church&#39;s message over the war efforts was nullified. Now the court did acknowledge that there was emotional harm and that the harm was bad, but they also considered that the political speech was upheld. As a result, the emotional harm was caused by the political speech, and not through an allegation of disruption. Thus, the West Borough Baptist Church won against the grieving funeral family.

This context and nuance is important, otherwise, you&#39;d be left off with the impression that the West Borough Baptist Church yells fire, in a crowded theater.
